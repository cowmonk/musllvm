# MUSLLVM

A simple make build system to make a pure musl clang/llvm toolchain.
Targeting x86_64.

# Dependencies
Here are some dependencies required to build this toolchain:
- a C compiler (preferably clang)
- curl
- make
- POSIX Unix utilities (GNU utilities are acceptable)

# Credits
* [Chimera linux](https://chimera-linux.org) - Majority of patches are sourced from chimera linux.
